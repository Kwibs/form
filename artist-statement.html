      <p><em>Fluid Form</em> is a net art project that explores the connection between athletics and art, celebrating the moment of action of soccer players. Users can interact with images of athletes frozen in that moment. When clicked, each image reveals a full video of the athlete in motion, showing the complete movement behind the pose.</p>

      <p>This project highlights the idea that athletic movement isn’t just functional—it’s also a form of art. Just as dancers convey emotion through their movements, soccer players express power, agility, and grace through their actions on the field. I want to show how the beauty of athletic movement can be as captivating as traditional art forms.</p>

      <p>The interactive nature of <em>Fluid Form</em> allows users to explore athletes’ motion, bridging the gap between still images and video. This makes the experience more dynamic, as viewers actively engage with the artwork. The piece celebrates the idea that modern digital art often requires interaction, allowing people to become part of the narrative. Ultimately, <em>Fluid Form</em> aims to show athletic performance as a unique and powerful form of creative expression.</p>
